**Dual-Clock Asynchronous FIFO (DC Async FIFO)**
**Overview**
The Dual-Clock Asynchronous FIFO (DC Async FIFO) is a hardware design module used to safely transfer data between two clock domains operating at different frequencies or phases. It provides reliable data buffering and synchronization, enabling communication across asynchronous clock domains without data loss or corruption.

**Features**

Supports independent read and write clocks.

Asynchronous pointer synchronization to prevent metastability.

Full and empty flag generation to avoid buffer overflows or underflows.

Parameterizable FIFO depth and data width.

Low latency and efficient resource usage.

Suitable for FPGA and ASIC implementations.

Typical Applications

Crossing clock domains in FPGA designs.

Data buffering between subsystems with different clock rates.

Handling asynchronous data streams in communication protocols.

Any design requiring safe and reliable data transfer across asynchronous clock boundaries.

How It Works

The FIFO uses separate read and write pointers updated by their respective clock domains. These pointers are synchronized asynchronously across domains using Gray code encoding to minimize metastability issues. The read logic knows when data is available, and the write logic knows when space is free, controlled by full and empty signals.

Interface
Signal Name	Direction	Description
wr_clk	Input	Write clock domain clock signal
rd_clk	Input	Read clock domain clock signal
rst	Input	Asynchronous reset (active high)
wr_en	Input	Write enable signal
rd_en	Input	Read enable signal
din	Input	Data input bus
dout	Output	Data output bus
full	Output	FIFO full flag
empty	Output	FIFO empty flag
wr_data_count	Output	Number of data words written but not read
rd_data_count	Output	Number of data words available for read
Parameters

DATA_WIDTH - Width of the data bus (default: 8 bits)

FIFO_DEPTH - Number of FIFO locations (default: 16 entries)

Usage

Instantiate the FIFO module in your design.

Connect wr_clk and rd_clk to your write and read domain clocks.

Use wr_en and rd_en to write and read data, respectively.

Monitor full and empty flags to avoid overflow and underflow.

Use reset to initialize or clear the FIFO as needed.
